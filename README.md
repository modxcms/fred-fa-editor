# Fred FA Editor

To use the Font Awesome icon picker, change the value of the `fred.icon_editor` system setting in the Fred namespace to `FAEditor`.

## Using the right version

We've added a system setting to link to FA on your frontend so that you are always using the same version as this plugin. You can add the link like so: 

```
<link href="[[++fredfaeditor.link]]" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
```

This link will be updated whenever you update the FA Editor.
